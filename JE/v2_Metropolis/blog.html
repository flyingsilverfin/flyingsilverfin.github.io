			A Celebration of Japanese Culture
		</h1>
		<p class="blog-post-text">
			From the outset our committee decided that we wanted our June Event to celebrate the diversity of world culture. We were instantly attracted to Tokyo because of its rich cosmopolitan culture; for years it has proudly projected a unique urban creativity. We strongly believe that a variety of elements within Japanese culture, which many of us know well, would lend themselves to a great festive experience. Individual members of the committee have diligently researched the cultural context of their respective projects with a view to ensuring that we provide a self-conscious and holistic representation of all that is great about Japanese urban culture. Moreover, wherever possible we have been in dialogue with Japanese artists and suppliers to make this experience as genuine as possible.
			<br><br>
			We are all so excited about this project, more detailed posts will follow up historically and culturally contextualising the various elements of our event so that on the night, everyone can appreciate and understand the significance and beauty of this rich culture.
			<br><br>
